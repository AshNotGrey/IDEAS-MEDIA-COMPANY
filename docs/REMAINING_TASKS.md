## 🛠 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Start development servers
cd Admin/client
npm run dev  # Admin PWA on http://localhost:5176

cd shared  
npm run dev  # Backend API on http://localhost:4000

# Test GraphQL playground
open http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

### **Component Development Pattern**
```jsx
// Example: ServiceList.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useServices } from '../../graphql/hooks/useServices.js';
import { Search, Plus, Filter } from 'lucide-react';

const ServiceList = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({});
  const { services, loading, error, refetch } = useServices(filters);

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Header with actions */}
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Services</h1>
        <Button onClick={() => setShowForm(true)}>
          <Plus size={20} />
          Add Service
        </Button>
      </div>

      {/* Filters and search */}
      <ServiceFilters filters={filters} onFiltersChange={setFilters} />

      {/* Services grid */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        {services.map(service => (
          <ServiceCard key={service.id} service={service} onUpdate={refetch} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **GraphQL Hook Pattern**
```javascript
// Example: useServices.js
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';
import { GET_ALL_SERVICES, CREATE_SERVICE, UPDATE_SERVICE } from '../queries/services.js';

export const useServices = (filters = {}) => {
  const { data, loading, error, refetch } = useQuery(GET_ALL_SERVICES, {
    variables: { filter: filters },
    errorPolicy: 'all'
  });

  const [createService] = useMutation(CREATE_SERVICE);
  const [updateService] = useMutation(UPDATE_SERVICE);

  return {
    services: data?.services?.items || [],
    totalItems: data?.services?.totalItems || 0,
    loading,
    error,
    refetch,
    createService: (input) => createService({ variables: { input } }),
    updateService: (id, input) => updateService({ variables: { id, input } })
  };
};
```
